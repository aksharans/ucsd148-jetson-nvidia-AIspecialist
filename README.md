## About

Adjust a DNN model, training it to classify different sports balls, specifically footballs and basketballs. With the influx of analytics in sports, there’s an inclination that AI could become more involved in the sense that it’s able to detect deeper info about the game. So, not just numbers and predictions, but being able to identify certain formations or plays or even regress on certain tendencies.
